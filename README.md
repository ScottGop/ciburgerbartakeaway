## Amendments
I would want to amend the view capability on a mobile device, I need to change the vh/vw settings to ensure all is clear for every viewing experience. It isnâ€™t 100% correct at this stage. Best viewed on Laptop screen. 
The 'win a free meal' button would ideally take the user to a second page allowing them to complete a short questionnaire so the company can gather data and contact information from the buyer for future promotions, if the customer submits a review and it is then used on the website; they will be notified and a free meal provided.
